 TESSDATA for TOI-1266 
I have collected data of TOI-1266 which is collected in 2024 in sector 76 have target ID =467179528
firstly i have use lightkurve library for collecting data of TOI-1266 in python . i have collected Target Pixel Files (TPF)
TPF =The TESS telescope observes stars for long periods of time, just under a month per sector. By doing so TESS observes how the brightnesses of a star change over time.Not all data for the stars in a given sector is recorded. Instead, pixels are selected around certain targeted stars. These cut-out images are called Target Pixel Files, or TPFs. By combining the amount of flux in the pixels where the star appears, you can make a measurement of the amount of light form a star in that observation.
